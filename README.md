## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

During this project, my primary goal was to become more comfortable with optimizing layout and responsiveness using various tools. Through this process, I was able to gain a deeper understanding of when to use Flexbox and CSS Grid for different layout scenarios.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to focus more on JavaScript and further improve my knowledge of semantic HTML and CSS. I want to become more proficient in writing clean and concise JavaScript code, and be able to utilize more advanced features and libraries. By doing so, I hope to create more polished and user-friendly websites in the future.

### Useful resources

- [A Complete Guide to Grid ](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This helped me incorporate Grids into my project.
